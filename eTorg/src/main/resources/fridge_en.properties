about=       Computer technology is becoming more and more advanced. \
			 This is fine because then I never will be out work. But remember...
fridgeTitle= It is the humans that controls the technology, and not the technology that controls the humans
problem=     But sometimes it makes me wonder. We own a refrigerator. \
			 If were are to relax and eat our breakfast, we will move food in and out of this technological miracle. \
			 If we are to quick with opening the fridge door because it just recently has been opened, \
			 then the fridge will protest and make the opening difficult. \
			 Last time the handle and opening-mechanism was destroyed, because I opened the fridge too quickly. \
			 So we had to do an expensive repair of the fridge. \
			 "You must be careful with the fridge, \
			 to avoid breaking it again", my partner stated. \
			 "You must not pull it too hard, and wait for a while since last time it was opened. \
			 Be gentle and careful when opening it. And note the fridge is not exactly tidy. \
			 If it is to much mess and old food inside it, \
			 the fridge will revenge us by letting the opening of the door be even harder and slower" <br\><br\>
cause=       The issue is related with the cooling capacity of the fridge and the number of kilos to be cooled inside it. \
			 I know that. If too much warm food and air are inserted, \
			 it will take a while before it will be easy to open the fridge again.  \
			 But I refuse to be bullied by a refrigerator. \
			 I am in control, and I will open and close the fridge door at any time as it pleases me. \
			 My fridge in the apartment in Oslo is even worse. \
			 You have to pull real hard if you have forgotten to take something in or out or the fridge \
			 and the time limit of two minutes has not exceeded. \
			 And it is not certain that you will be able to open the fridge door immediately at all. \
			 The result is that food that should have been stored in a cool place, \
			 resides on the kitchen table because I do not bother to wait.<br\><br\>
cars=        I think with disgust what will happen when we have self-running cars. \
		     We will end up in a quite different place than intended. \
		     It is an illusion to believe that all the sensors the cars are dependent on will be functioning all the time. \
		     In our house we have various quite new thermostats. \
		     These quite often stops working, and have to be reset every time after a power outage. \
		     If the sensors is like that in those cars, \
		     we will soon be moving towards the catastrophe and total chaos on the highway.
