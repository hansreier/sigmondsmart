smart=	The idea behind SigmondsMart is to create a marked place for ideas, discussions and open source software. \
		The intent is certainly more ambitious that the contents published here at any time. \
		I have also installed web demo software on this site that can be run by anyone and that periodically is developed and improved. \		
demo=	Demo software written by Hans Reier Sigmond.
demoh=  Technology:
demo1=  Java EE 8 / JSF (Java Server Faces) 2.2 / Spring 4.2 / Hibernate / css / Javascript.
demo1a= I have started to use Primefaces, e.g. for main menu.
demo2=  JSF is recommended if you want web app to run on everything (tablet, mobile or PC).
demo3=  JSF does not require that much Javascript based knowlegde, but to know CSS is required.
demo4=  JSF uses XHTML where the HTML/Javascript on the client is generated and transferred from the server.
demo5=	All products, payment and shipping in etorg demo app are virtual.
demo6=	Nothing is stored in the MySQL database, unless you define yourself as a user.
demo7=	The security solution is temporarily simple, so do not reuse passwords from elsewhere. 
demo8=	Contact the author by email if interested: reier.sigmond@gmail.com.
demo9=	SigmondsMart uses a virtualLinux server by Oxxus and Tomcat 8.
demo10=	I am web master.
demo11=	The software is configurable with Java/Spring (annotation based) configuration.
demo12=	The configuration can be extended to run on various platforms.
demo13=	E.g. runnable on IBM Bluemix cloud / IBM WebSphere Liberty / Db2 platform.
trends= <b>Comment to technology trends within web application development: </b><br/>\
        Currently many web applications are developed using Javascript based client frameworks like Angular JS (Rest included). \
		This method is getting more popular and is closer to basic HTML/HTTP. \
		Javascript based frameworks allows more specialized adaption to specific devices like mobiles. \
		I have plans of including these more modern technologies in this website, but not done yet. \
		Something that is certain is that the development of technologies continues.. \
		We are not guaranteed that e.g. Angular JS is hot 5 years from now? \	    
lang=	<b>If you can read this in English, then your browser settings is not set to be Norwegian (or set incorrectly).</b> \
		Nettstedet er språkuavhengig / The web site is language independent. \
		Språk angis av standard oppsett i web browser / Language is set by your default web browser settings. \
		Språket kan endres av språkmenyen nederst på siden / The language can be changed by the language menu at the bottom of the page. \
		I do not like bad automatic Google language translations like 'the fast window walked on reason outside the limped bank'. \
		Web browser language settings that works for this web site:<br/> \
		- en: Engelsk / English, standard / default <br/> \
		- no: Norsk / Norwegian, dersom funnet / if found <br/> \	
me=		Professionally I am a software developer with a lot of experience from object oriented development in several languages.  \
		I have been programming a lot in Java/web/web services, and a lot of  C/C++ stuff earlier. \
		I have also developed using Delphi/RAD. I have made Windows desktop GUI in Delphi, but also \
		interfaces towards email (IMAP,SMTP), Outlook/Exchange (Mapi) and Web Services. \
		If I compare Delphi to Java, I think that developing in Delphi is somewhat quicker than Java,  \
		but remark that it was web applications that I developed in Java. \
		The portability of Java based applications is anyhow hard to beat. \
		Note that Delphi XE5 FireMonkey can produce native binary code to Windows, IOS and Android (not done that). \
		Open source software have in my opinion many advantages but also disadvantages. \
		I have also practiced TDD (Test Driven Development), which is heavily supported in Java, \
		and I have worked with test automation (Junit, Mockito, Fitnesse for integration test,..). \
		<b>My specialty is product development</b>. With that I mean development where the long term aspects of reuse and maintainability are important. \
		This applies to all phases in the development process from analysis and design to programming and testing.<br/><br/> \
		I live in Moelv, Hedmark, Norway with with female partner and two cats. When I am not looking at the TV or computer screen \
		I do outdoors activities like orienteering and cross country skiing. I can if required do other things like painting and carpentry but with some risk  \
		of spilling paint and getting myself hurt. I am OK at assembling IKEA furniture though. \
		I have also opinions regarding political issues and society, but since these does not fit with political party programs \
		and I am not willing to compromise I am no politician.
